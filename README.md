# wall-e-watch-fenix
A first attempt at a watch face for most of the Garmin Fenix 5 lineup.

Considerable thanks to Franco Trimboli for posting his https://github.com/sunpazed/garmin-nyan-cat watchface, which I bummed a fair bit off of. 

Watchface is a bit hacked together, but it's alright for now, just gotta do some work to get dimensions actually working OK for watches that aren't 240px diameter round watches, plus maybe add some settings.
